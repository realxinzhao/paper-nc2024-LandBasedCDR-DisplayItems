Fig.1 Contributions of land-based carbon dioxide removal measures. The left panel shows the relationship between global cumulative CO2 removals/emissions in 2020 – 2100 for LULUCF and BECCS, while the right panel shows the relationship between LULUCF and Energy and Industrial Process (EIP) emissions, projected by climate change mitigation pathways. Each dot represents a projection from an IPCC AR6 pathway (square) or mitigation pathways generated in the present study using GCAM (round). The square dots (n = 604) in both panels are projections from IPCC AR6 2 °C pathways (in C1 – C4 categories) and with Carbon Budgets (CBs) in [175, 1475] GtCO2, distinguished by CB subranges (filled color; 500 and 1150 are interquartile values).

Fig. 3 Impact of land carbon pricing strength on 2 °C futures. Projections from the Main (2 °C) scenarios with varying land carbon pricing strengths, from no land carbon pricing (No-LCP) to 100% land carbon pricing (100%-LCP), are presented for global cumulative (A) and annual (B) carbon emissions, primary bioenergy demand and supply (C), land use change (D), land carbon dioxide removal (CDR) efficiency (E), and the decomposition of land CDR efficiency (F). All scenarios have a net total cumulative emissions of 1150 GtCO2. Carbon dioxide emissions/removals in panels (A) and (B) show contributions by Fossil Fuels and Industry (FFI), BECCS (by feedstock sources: residue & MSW or purpose-grown energy crop), and LULUCF. The final energy sectors include industry, buildings, and transportation. The peak carbon emission year and corresponding cumulative emissions are highlighted (red vertical lines) in panel (B). Stacked bars in panel (C) show the 2020 – 2100 mean primary second-generation bioenergy supply by source (positive values) and demand by sector (negative values). Stacked bars in panel (D) present land use change decomposition by 2050 and 2100 and the mean value in 2020 – 2100. Points in panel (E) present the relationship between the 2020 – 2100 mean land-based CDR and the corresponding land implication so that the slope of the lines implies 2020 – 2100 mean land CDR efficiency. The slope of background lines (grey), for reference, is labeled (in blue with a unit of tCO2 per hectare per year). Panel (F) decomposes panel (E) by land-based CDR sources and the corresponding land use, including nonland-based BECCS (no land attribution), land-based BECCS vs. purpose-grown energy cropland (slopes annotated in orange), and LULUCF vs. forest (slopes annotated in green).
